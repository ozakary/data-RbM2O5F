# Experimental $^{19}$F $\delta_{iso}$ as a function of computed $\sigma_{iso}$. The teal dots correspond to NbF$_{5}$ (\textit{a} and \textit{b}) and TaF$_{5}$ (\textit{c} and \textit{d}) compounds, while the orange dot corresponds to the RbF compound. The dark blue lines represent the linear-least-squares fit whose equations and \textit{R}-squared values are given in the panels.
