# The 19F MAS NMR spectra of RbNb2O5F (a) and RbTa2O5F (b) were plotted by running the Python scripts, exported, arranged in "Inskscape", and then saved as a .pdf file.

# To generate the data files: ./simulated_spectrum_chunk_*.csv
# you will need to follow the instruction given in the README.md file in the folder: data-RbM2O5F/simulated_nmr_spectra
