# Experimental (dark blue) and fitted (dashed red) $^{19}$F MAS NMR (20 T) spectra of RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (46 kHz, \textit{a}) and RbTa$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (50 kHz, \textit{b}). The individual resonances used for the fit (teal and orange) and the difference (grey) are shown below. The asterisks refer to spinning sidebands.
