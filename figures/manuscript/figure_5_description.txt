# Diagrammatic presentation showcasing, (\textit{i}) the simultaneous distribution (Group n째1 and n째2) of the Rb and O/F in 32\textit{e} and 48\textit{f}, respectively, and (\textit{ii}) the two-step distribution, with first, distributing Rb in 32\textit{e} (Group n째1), and second, distributing O/F in 48\textit{f} (Group n째2). $N_{eq}$ and $N_{ineq}$ refer to the number of configurations equivalent and inequivalent by symmetry operations, respectively. The selected configurations with the lowest and highest $E_{Ewald}$ energies are labeled as $N_{select}\{E_{Ewald}^{(\searrow)}\}$ and $N_{select}\{E_{Ewald}^{(\nearrow)}\}$, respectively. $N_{tot}$ refers to the total selected number of configurations for subsequent analysis of [NbO$_{6-x}$F$_{x}$]$^{n-}$ octahedra and [RbO$_{18-y}$F$_{y}$]$^{m-}$ cages from RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F.
