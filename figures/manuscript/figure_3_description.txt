# Experimental (red), calculated (dark blue), and difference (grey) diffraction patterns of both compounds. The teal vertical markers refer to the Bragg positions. The obtained refinement reliability factors of RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (RbTa$_{2}$O$_{5}$F) are $R_{p}$ = 10.8 (10.8) \%, $R_{wp}$ = 8.7 (10.1) \%, $R_{exp}$ = 2.3 (2.1) \%, $R_{B}$ = 4.3 (4.8) \%, and $R_{F}$ = 3.9 (3.6) \%.
