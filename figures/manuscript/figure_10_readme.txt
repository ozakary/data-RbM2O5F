# The 87Rb MAS and 3QMAS, and 93Nb MAS and 3QMAS NMR spectra of RbNb2O5F (a and c) and RbTa2O5F (b) were plotted by running the Python scripts, exported, arranged in "Inskscape", and then saved as a .pdf file.

# To generate the data files: ./simulated_spectrum_chunk_*.csv
# you will need to follow the instruction given in the README.md file in the folder: data-RbM2O5F/simulated_nmr_spectra
