# 3D charts representing the GIM distribution $P(C_{Q}, \eta_{Q})$ (in \textit{a.u.}) constructed from the average $C_Q$ and $\eta_Q$ values that were used to fit the experimental (CT)MAS and 3QMAS spectra from RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{a} and \textit{b} for $^{87}$Rb and $^{93}$Nb, respectively) and RbTa$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{c} for $^{87}$Rb). Similar charts were constructed using the computed $C_Q$ and $\eta_Q$ values from the final configurations for RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{d} and \textit{e} for $^{87}$Rb and $^{93}$Nb, respectively) and RbTa$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{f} for $^{87}$Rb). Each point in these charts represents one $C_Q$ and one $\eta_Q$ value from one Rb/Nb atom.
