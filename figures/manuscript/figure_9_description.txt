# Experimental (solid line) and theoretical (dashed line) $^{19}$F MAS (46 and 50 kHz for \textit{a} and \textit{b}, respectively) NMR spectra of RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{a}) and RbTa$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{b}). Both theoretical spectra correspond to the final configurations, and they were simulated using the \textit{Python} package "\textit{mrsimulator}". The asterisks refer to spinning sidebands. the top-left insets present zooms of the main resonance lines.
