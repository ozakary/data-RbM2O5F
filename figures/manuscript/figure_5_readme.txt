# This diagrammatic presentation was built using "Inkscape". The plot was generated by running the python script, exported, arranged with the rest in "Inkscape", and then saved as a .pdf file.

# To run properly the Python script you will need to generate the data file: figure_5_data-1.csv and figure_5_data-2.csv
# These data files are: ./step-2_OF_dist/concatenated_configs_NbX6_l.csv and ./step-2_OF_dist/concatenated_configs_NbX6_l.csv
# To generate them visit the folder "./data-RbM2O5F/configurations_generation_steps/" and follow the instructions.
