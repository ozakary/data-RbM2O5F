# The histograms of the populations [Nb6-xFx]n- (a) and [Rb18-yFy]m- (b) were plotted by running the Python scripts, exported, arranged in "Inskscape", and then saved as a .pdf file.

# To run properly the Python script you will need to generate the data file: figure_6_data-1.csv and figure_6_data-2.csv
# For [NbO6-xFx]n-, these data files are: ./step-2_OF_dist/concatenated_configs_NbX6_l.csv and ./step-2_OF_dist/concatenated_configs_NbX6_l.csv
# For [RbO18-yFy]m-, these data files are: ./step-2_OF_dist/concatenated_configs_RbX18_l.csv and ./step-2_OF_dist/concatenated_configs_RbX18_l.csv
# To generate them visit the folder "./data-RbM2O5F/configurations_generation_steps/" and follow the instructions.
