# Experimental (solid line) and theoretical (dashed line) MAS (30 kHz for $^{87}$Rb) and CTMAS (100 kHz for $^{93}$Nb) NMR (20 T) spectra of RbNb$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{a} and \textit{c}) and RbTa$_{2}$O$_{5}$F (\textit{b}). The insets represent zooms of the central transition (top-left of \textit{a}, \textit{b}, and \textit{c}) and the three first-order satellite transitions (top-right of \textit{a} and \textit{b}). All theoretical spectra correspond to the final configurations, and they were simulated using the \textit{Python} package "\textit{mrsimulator}".
